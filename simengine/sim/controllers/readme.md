Here is a collection of steering controllers

# Force controller #

Flocking/boids based steering controller. Uses virtual forces to pick best direction of movement

# Velocity obstacle #

VO, VO2, RVO - a set of implementations of velocity obstacle approach. In this approach we calculate non-collision velocity space, that our vehicle can choose
